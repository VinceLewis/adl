# ADL Language Specification

ADL source is the author-facing syntax for producing a partial application
model. Runtime services do not consume this syntax directly; `compileAdl`
parses source, resolves defaults, validates the resolved model, and returns the
same resolved-model contract that JSON fixtures use.

## Syntax Shape

The current parser is line-oriented and block-based. Top-level declarations use
uppercase keywords and explicit `END.*` block terminators.

- `APP Name` declares the application. `START_VIEW` may name the initial view.
- `ROLE Name` declares an application role.
- `CONTEXT Name` declares a business context, optional selection behavior, and
  optional membership object mapping.
- `OBJECT Name` declares fields, computed fields, object validations,
  scopes, constraints, lifecycles, and views.
- `POLICY Name ON Object` declares policy rules for one object.
- `THEME Name BASE BuiltInTheme` declares token overrides.
- `READ_MODEL Name` declares backend-neutral read-model sources, output fields,
  expression fields, and sort order.
- `DECISION_TABLE Name ON Object` declares object-scoped decision-table inputs,
  rows, outputs, and optional defaults.
- `COMMAND Name` declares model-driven command inputs, preconditions, and create
  or update steps.

Unsupported procedural or host-code syntax is rejected. ADL source does not
contain SQL, Dart, Flutter, Elixir, LiveView, loops, arbitrary host functions, or
storage-engine declarations.

## Objects And Fields

Objects contain business fields. Field syntax supports text, number, date,
datetime, time, boolean, and attachment types. A field may be `REQUIRED`, have a
literal `DEFAULT`, validators, lookup metadata, and author-facing display or key
roles through the resolved model.

Objects can declare business context scope and backend-neutral constraints:

```adl
SCOPE Band FIELD Band
CONSTRAINT uniqueSongTitleInBand UNIQUE SCOPE Band FIELDS Title
CONSTRAINT orderedSetListItems ORDERED SCOPE Band PARENT SetList POSITION Position
```

The compiler maps these declarations to the resolved model; runtime services
enforce scope and constraints.

Computed fields are declared inside objects:

```adl
COMPUTED FIELD Gross NUMBER = UnitPrice * Quantity
```

Computed fields are runtime read-time fields. They are not persisted business
fields and are not writable.

## Expressions

The parser supports expressions in implemented semantic slots: predicate
validators, policy `WHEN` clauses, object validations, lifecycle guards,
decision-table inputs and rows, command preconditions, computed fields, and
read-model expression fields.

Implemented expression forms include literals, field references,
`runtime.userId`, `runtime.now`, unary `NOT` and numeric negation, binary
arithmetic, comparisons, boolean `AND`/`OR`, and null coalescing. The resolved
model stores expressions as structured trees.

## Policies

Policy rules are declared for a single object. Rules can allow, deny, readonly,
mask, or hide an action for principals. Principals can match everyone,
authenticated users, anonymous users, owners, specific users, roles, group
roles, or owner-as-specific.

Lifecycle transition policy can name an action and state. Field rules restrict
specific fields. Conditions compile to resolved expressions.

## Lifecycles

Objects may declare a lifecycle with states and actions. A lifecycle action
declares source states, a target state, optional guards, optional policy
references, and optional hook names. Hook names are references only; registered
runtime hooks decide behavior.

## Read Models

Read models declare named object sources and output fields. A field can project
from a source field or evaluate an expression over already-projected row values.
Read models are backend-neutral; they do not embed SQL or materialization
strategy.

Views and read models can declare context requirements:

```adl
VIEW BandEventList LIST
  CONTEXT REQUIRED Band
  FIELDS Date Title Status
END.VIEW

READ_MODEL HomeUpcomingEvents
  CONTEXT ALL Band
  SOURCE event OBJECT Event SCOPE allAvailableContexts
END.READ_MODEL
```

## Commands

Commands declare typed inputs, command-level preconditions, and create/update
steps. Step values can come from literals, command input, runtime values, or
earlier step records. Commands remain model data; runtime services execute them.
